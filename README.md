# BatCap
Android app for cutting off charging at a certain level, by communicating with external hardware.

See my [blog post](https://benjames.io/2019/07/07/charging-stand).

It's an extremely simple app which waits for the charge to reach a predetermined level then flashes the torch to tell the charger to cut power.
